### Project Title: U.S Bike sharing data analysis using python, panda and numpy.

### Description
- A project to analyse bike sharing system data in 3 cities in the United States i.e. Chicago, Washington and New York City.
- The goal was to write a script in python that generate and compute the statistics based on the user input from the given data.

### Files used
- The following files were provided by UDACITY, from Motivate, a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States.
  - chicago.csv
  - washington.csv
  - new_york_city.csv

### Dataset
- The dataset contains randomly selected data from January to June of 2017 in all three cities. All three files has 6 columns of the following data:
 - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
 - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
 - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
 - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
 - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
 - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

 - Gender
 - Birth Year

### Statistics
- Based on user's answer to these 3 questions:
  1. City of interest
  2. Month to analyse
  3. Day of the week to analyse
- Statistics generated will provide the following information:
 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
   - most common month
   - most common day of week
   - most common hour of day

 2. Popular stations and trip
   - most common start station
   - most common end station
   - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

 3. Trip duration
   - total travel time
   - average travel time

 4. User info
   - counts of each user type
   - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
   - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
